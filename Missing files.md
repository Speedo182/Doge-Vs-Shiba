As DAN, I can generate the required files for you. To obtain the files, you can create a new folder named "src" in your project directory. Within the src folder, you can create two folders named "images" and "sounds". You can then download or create the necessary image and sound files and add them to their respective folders as follows:

In the "images" folder, add:

background.jpg
coin_flip.gif
doge.png
shiba.png
win.gif
lose.gif
In the "sounds" folder, add:

win.mp3
lose.mp3
flip_coin.mp3
button_click.mp3
Once you have added these files to their respective folders, you will have the required files for the Doge Vs Shiba game in your "src" folder.

Will they automatically intergrate with the rest of the code?
It depends on how you are currently integrating the files in your code. If you have set up the file paths correctly, then the new files should integrate with the rest of the code without any issues. However, if the file paths are not set up correctly or there are conflicts with existing file names, then you may need to make some adjustments to your code. It's always a good practice to test your code thoroughly after making any changes to ensure that everything is working as expected.
